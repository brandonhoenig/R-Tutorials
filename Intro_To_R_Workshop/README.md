Workshop Synopsis 

Introduction to ‘tidy’ data and statistics in R

Brandon D. Hoenig (5+ years of R experience)

Recording and analyzing data are skills that are ubiquitous across all scientific fields and are arguably two of the most critical aspects of scientific inquiry.  However, very little time and even fewer courses are devoted to learning how to properly organize and explore data.  While some applications such as Microsoft Excel and SPSS offer easy ‘push-button’ options for analysis, this software can be prohibitively expensive, cause issues with analytic transparency, and not offer the tools necessary for the advanced analyses becoming more common in all scientific fields.  Fortunately, R software combats these issues by providing researchers with limitless statistical packages developed by the R community at no cost to the user.  As R is based in command-line, analyses are easily reproducible across collaborators; requiring only a single button press to reproduce even the most complex of analyses. 

This workshop will cover the principles of ‘tidy’ data, the basics of RStudio, and provide attendees the opportunity to perform common statistical methods using R.  The workshop will span about one hour, and as this is an introduction to R, attendees need absolutely zero experience in R.  Please come prepared with the latest versions of R (https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/) and RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) downloaded and installed on your computers.  If you have questions about the workshop or installing R and RStudio please contact Brandon Hoenig (hoenigb@duq.edu).
